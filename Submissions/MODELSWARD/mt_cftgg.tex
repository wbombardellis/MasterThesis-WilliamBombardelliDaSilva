\noindent In this section, we offer a short literary review on the graph grammar and triple graph grammar approaches that are more relevant to our work. We focus, therefore, on the context-free node label replacement approach for graph grammars, although, there is a myriad of different alternatives to it, for example, the algebraic approach \cite{ehrig1999handbook}. We refer to context-free grammars, inspired by the use of such classification for string grammars, in a relaxed way without any compromise to any definition.

%We divide the node label replacement approaches into context-sensitive and context-free approaches, we refer to context-sensitive and context-free grammars, inspired by the use of such classification for string grammars, in a relaxed way without any compromise to any definition of context-freeness for graph grammars. The context-sensitive field includes the \textit{layered graph grammar}, whose semantics consists of the replacement of graphs by other graphs governed by morphisms \cite{rekers1997defining} and for which exponential-time bottom-up parsing algorithms have been proposed \cite{rekers1995graph,bottoni2000efficient,furst2011improving}. Another context-sensitive formalism is the \textit{reserved graph grammar}, that is based on the replacement of directed graphs by necessarily greater directed graphs governed by simple embedding rules \cite{zhang2001context} and for which exponential and polynomial-time bottom-up algorithms have been proposed in \cite{zeng2005rgg+,zou2017partial}.

In the node label replacement context-free formalisms stand out the \textit{node label controlled graph grammar} (NLC) and its successor \textit{graph grammar with neighborhood-controlled embedding} (NCE). NLC is based on the replacement of one vertex by a graph, governed by embedding rules written in terms of the vertex's label \cite{rozenberg1986boundary}. For various classes of these grammars, there exist polynomial-time top-down and bottom-up parsing algorithms \cite{flasinski1993parsing,flasinski2014characteristics,rozenberg1986boundary,wanke1991algorithms}. The recognition complexity and generation power of such grammars have also been analyzed \cite{flasinski1998power,kim2012structure}. NCE occurs in several formulations, including a context-sensitive one, but here we focus on the context-free formulation, where one vertex is replaced by a graph, and the embedding rules are written in terms of the vertex's neighbors \cite{janssens1982graph,skodinis1998neighborhood}. For some classes of these grammars, polynomial-time bottom-up parsing algorithms and automaton formalisms were proposed and analyzed \cite{kim2001efficient,brandenburg2005finite}. In special, one of these classes is the \textit{boundary graph grammar with neighborhood-controlled embedding} (BNCE), that is used in our approach for model transformation.

Regarding TGG \cite{schurr1994specification}, a 20 years review of the realm is put forward by Anjorin et al. \cite{anjorin201620}. In special, advances are made in the direction of expressiveness with the introduction of application conditions \cite{klar2010extended} and of modularization \cite{anjorin2014modularizing}. Furthermore, in the algebraic approach for graph grammars, we have found proposals that introduce inheritance \cite{bardohl2004integrating,hermann2008typed} and variables \cite{hoffmann2005graph} to the formalisms. Nevertheless, we do not know any approach that introduces non-terminal symbols to TGG with the purpose of gaining expressiveness or usability. In this sense, our proposal brings something new to the current state-of-the-art.
