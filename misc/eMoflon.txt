# Installing eMoflon
1. Download and install Eclipse Oxygen for modelling
2. Help > Install New Software > Add
	* eMoflonCore - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eMoflon/emoflon-core-updatesite/emoflon-core_1.2.0/stable/updatesite/
	* eMoflon - https://github.com/eMoflon/eMoflon.github.io/raw/emoflon-tool-updatesite_3.2.0/eclipse-plugin/beta/updatesite

# Running Example
1. Follow the instruction in the handbook
	* Maybe it is necessary to add the dependencies manually to the MANIFEST.MF of the plug-in (All moflon and the metamodels' packages, including SDMLanguage)
	* Maybe it is necessary to add the properties "Meta Model Project" manually to the moflon.properties.xmi file with the same name of the one in the metamodels' properties file

# Creating new eMoflon Transformation
1. Use eMoflon perspective on Eclipse
2. Create new project for the metamodel
	1. Create new `eMoflon EMF Project` (at eMoflon toolbar)
	2. Create the elements of the metamodel
		* No element can have the a name that occur in EPackage
		* Elements' names must begin with capital letters
	3. Build projects fully (at eMoflon toolbar)
3. Create new project for the TGG
	1. Create new `Integration Project` (at eMoflon toolbar)
	2. Open `...org.moflon.tgg.mosl/Schema.tgg` file and edit it by
		1. Adding the imports
		2. Declaring source, target and correspondence metamodels
	3. Build projects fully (at eMoflon toolbar)
	4. In the package `...org.moflon.tgg.mosl.rules`, create a new TGG rules (at eMoflon tollbar)
	5. Add metamodel(s) and eMoflon plugins to dependencies of `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`
4. Create a new instance model for testing
	1. On the root metamodel element, right-click, then `Create Dynamic Instance`
	2. Save this file in `instances/fwd.src.xmi` inside the eMoflon integration project
5. Run eMoflon transformer
	1. Right-click on `... org.emoflon.tie/Trafo.java`, then `Run as Java Application`
	2. Refresh `instances` folder and check the `fwd.trg.xmi` file

# Troubleshooting
* `Schema.tgg` cannot find schemata
	* Rebuild all without errors
* After building all, source code shows some errors by not being able to find packages
	* Add dependencies to MANIFEST.md, inclusive `org.eclipse.core.*`
* eMoflon excpetion NullPointer
	* Add a metamodel project name in `moflon.properties.xmi`
* New Rule is not generated in the ECore models of the TGG, or this model is not created at all
	* Some rule may be wrong so that it blocks the generation of ECore models. Possible cause: NACs
	* Clean project, remove all generated files, remove rules and recreate them, restart eclipse and build all again
* Code generation stops at 72%
	* Some rules might be wrong. Verify them carefully and try to make them simpler or smaller by removing elements

# Reasons to use eMoflon
* Works with a more recent version of eclipse (Oxygen)
* Extensive and up-to-date documentation (2017)
* A lot of publication reporting the workings of the tool
* Occurence of the tool in surveys
* Formalism very near to the ones of the communities' publications
