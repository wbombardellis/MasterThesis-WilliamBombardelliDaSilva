	abstract = {Graph grammars may be used as natural and powerful syntax-definition formalisms for visual programming languages. Yet most graph-grammar parsing algorithms presented so far are either unable to recognize interesting visual languages or tend to be inefficient (with exponential time complexity) when applied to graphs with a large number of nodes and edges. This paper presents a context-sensitive graph grammar called reserved graph grammar, which can explicitly and completely describe the syntax of a wide range of diagrams using labeled graphs. The parsing algorithm of a reserved graph grammar uses a marking mechanism to avoid ambiguity in parsing and has polynomial time complexity in most cases. The paper defines a constraint condition under which a graph defined in a reserved graph grammar can be parsed in polynomial time. An algorithm for checking the condition is also provided.},

	abstract = {Visual language specification has been investigated for more than two decades now and many different formalisms for specifying and parsing visual languages have been invented. However, there has been little attempt to develop a systematic and comprehensive hierarchy of visual languages based on their formal properties. Given the importance of the Chomsky hierarchy for the theory of textual languages and the difficulty of comparing these many different visual language formalisms, it is clear that there is a need for such a hierarchy. We develop a hierarchy for visual languages and investigate the expressiveness and cost of parsing for classes defined therein. Although the hierarchy is based on the constraint multiset grammar formalism, we sketch how other visual language specification formalisms can be mapped into constraint multiset grammars so that a comparison is made possible. One consequence of our work is that a large class of 'naturally occurring' visual languages are inherently context-sensitive, so that the core of such a hierarchy has to be built around different forms of context-sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

However, the description and implementation difficulties of graph grammars hinder their wide applications.

Then, based on the mechanism, a new parsing algorithm is proposed, which is easily designed and implemented by using the XML technique.},

	abstract = {Motivated by applications that require mechanisms for describing the structure of object-oriented programs, adaptive star grammars are introduced, and their fundamental properties are studied. In adaptive star grammars, rules are actually schemata which, via the cloning of so-called multiple nodes, may adapt to potentially infinitely many contexts when they are applied. This mechanism makes adaptive star grammars more powerful than context-free graph grammars. Nevertheless, they turn out to be restricted enough to share some of the basic characteristics of context-free devices. In particular, the underlying substitution operator enjoys associativity and confluence properties quite similar to those of context-free graph grammars, and the membership problem for adaptive star grammars is decidable. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

They describe systems at different layers of abstraction and with a focus to different domains. For each domain, dedicated domain specific visual modelling languages are used for model definitions with the idea to separate concerns to different domain experts. This enables precise problem and requirement definitions and should decrease efforts in developing and validating systems. We focus on multi-view models that are in relationship with source models by triple graph grammars. A multi-view model provides different views of the source model at different layers of abstraction but within the same DSL which is typically different from the DSL of the source model. In practice, elements in different views may overlap. We present an informal methodology for consistently propagating updates from one view to the other views and also to the source domain. We motivate our approach by multi-view models in a hospital scenario.},
